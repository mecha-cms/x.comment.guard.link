Limit the number of links that go into comments with this extension. You can set the maximum number of links allowed in
a comment by setting the `content` value in `.\lot\x\comment.guard.link\state.php` file. The `link` property is used to
determine whether an anchor that surrounds the comment author’s name in the default comment markup should be removed or
not. Please note that this will also get rid of the link field in comment form.

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'content' => 5,
    'link' => false
];
~~~

If you set the `content` value to `true`, it will allow links in comments. Value as a number less than `0` will convert
all links in comment content into plain text. If you set the `content` value to `0` or `false`, it will disallow any
links in comments. Value as a number greater than `0` will limit the number of links you can put in a comment.

If you set the `link` value to `true`, then it is the same as enabling the link field in comment form. If you set the
`link` value to `0` or `false`, it will remove the link field in comment form. Value as a number less than `0` will
remove the link field in comment form including anchor tags that surround the comment author’s name in the existing
comments.

This extension does not change the existing comments data, it only changes their presentation when they appear in the
default comments layout.
