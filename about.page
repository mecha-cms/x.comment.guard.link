Limit the number of links that go into comments with this extension. This extension does not change the existing
comments data, it only changes their presentation when they appear in the comments layout. You can set the maximum
number of links allowed in a comment by setting the `content` value in `.\lot\x\comment.guard.link\state.php` file. The
`link` property is used to determine whether an anchor that surrounds the comment author’s name in the default comment
markup should be removed or not, and whether you want to strip all links in the existing comments or not. Please note
that this will also get rid of the link field in the comment form.

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'content' => 5,
    'link' => false
];
~~~

If you set the `content` value to be less than `0`, then it is the same as disabling this restriction feature.

If you set the `link` value to `0`, it will only remove the link field from the comment form. Value as a number greater
than `0` will be considered as `true` value (which would be equivalent to not using this extension at all). Value as a
number less than `0` will remove the anchor that surrounds the comment author’s name and will convert all links in the
comment content into plain text.
