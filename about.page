Limit the number of links in comments with this extension. You can set the maximum number of links allowed in a comment
by setting the `content` value in the `.\lot\x\comment.guard.link\state.php` file. The `link` property is used to
determine whether or not to remove an anchor that surrounds the comment author’s name in the default comment markup.
Note that this will also remove the link field in the comment form.

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'content' => 5,
    'link' => false
];
~~~

If you set the `content` value to `true`, it will allow links in comments. Value as a number less than `0` will convert
all links in comment content to plain text. If you set the `content` value to `0` or `false`, it will not allow any
links in comments. Value as a number greater than `0` will limit the number of links you can put in a comment.

If you set the `link` value to `true`, then it is the same as enabling the link field in the comment form. If you set
the `link` value to `0` or `false`, it will remove the link field in the comment form. Value as a number less than `0`
will remove the link field in the comment form, including the anchor tags surrounding the comment author’s name in the
existing comments.

Key | Value | Description
--- | ----- | -----------
`content` | `-1` | Disallow links in comments and remove all links in existing comments.
`content` | `0` | Disallow links in comments.
`content` | `5` | Allow a maximum of 5 links to be included in a comment.
`content` | `false` | Disallow links in comments.
`content` | `true` | Allow links in comments.
`link` | `-1` | Hide the link field in the comment form and remove the anchor tags surrounding the comment author’s name.
`link` | `0` | Hide the link field in the comment form.
`link` | `false` | Hide the link field in the comment form.
`link` | `true` | Show the link field in the comment form.

This extension does not change the existing comments data, it only changes their presentation when they are presented in
the default comments layout.
